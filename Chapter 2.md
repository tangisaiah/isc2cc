Chapter 2 Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster, Recovery Concepts
---------
## Module 1: Understand Incident Response

### Incident Terminology
* **Breach**: The **loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition**, 
or any similar occurrence where: an **unauthorized user accesses** or **potentially accesses** personally identifiable information; 
or an authorized user accesses personally identifiable information **for other than an authorized purpose**.
* **Event**: Any**observable occurrence** in a network or system.
* **Exploit**: A particular attack. It is named this way because these attacks exploit system **vulnerabilities**.
* **Incident**: An event that **actually or potentially jeopardizes** the **confidentiality, integrity or availability** of an information system or 
the information the system **processes, stores or transmits**.
* **Intrusion**: A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a **deliberate security incident** in which an intruder **gains, or attempts to gain**, 
access to a system or system resource **without authorization**. 
* **Threat**: Any circumstance or event with the potential to **adversely impact organizational operations** (including mission, functions, image or reputation), 
organizational assets, individuals, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, 
modification of information and/or denial of service.
* **Vulnerability**: **Weakness** in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.
* **Zero Day**: A **previously unknown system vulnerability** with the potential of exploitation** without risk of detection or prevention** because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods.

### The Goal of Incident Response
* It's **inevitable** that adverse events will happen that have the potential to affect the business mission or objectives.
* Priority of reponse is to protect life, health and safety. Always **choose safety first**.
* The primary goal of incident management is to **be prepared**. (having a policy and a response plan that will lead the organization through the crisis)
* Event = no harm, incident = possible harm

### Components of the Incident Response Plan
#### Preparation
* Develop a policy approved by management.
* Identify critical data and systems, single points of failure.
* Train staff on incident response.
* Implement an incident response team. (covered in subsequent topic)
* Practice Incident Identification. (First Response)
* Identify Roles and Responsibilities.
* Plan the coordination of communication between stakeholders.
* Consider the possibility that a primary method of communication may not be available.

#### Detection and Analysis
* Monitor all possible attack vectors.
* Analyze incident using known data and threat intelligence.
* Prioritize incident response.
* Standardize incident documentation.

#### Containment
* Gather **evidence**.
* Choose an appropriate containment strategy.
* **Identify** the attacker.
* **Isolate** the attack.

#### Post-Incident Activity
* Identify evidence that may need to be retained.
* Document lessons learned.

### Incident Response Team
They are the first ones on the scene and know how to differentiate typical IT problems from security incidents
<br />Potential team members include the following:
* Representative(s) of senior management
* Information security professionals
* Legal representatives
* Public affairs/communications representatives
* Engineering representatives (system and network)

<br />Computer incident response teams (CIRTs) four primary responsibilities:\
* Determine the **amount and scope of damage** caused by the incident.
* Determine whether any confidential information was **compromised** during the incident.
* Implement any **necessary recovery procedures** to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
* **Supervise** the implementation of any **additional security measures** necessary to **improve security and prevent recurrence** of the incident.

## Module 2: Understand Buisness Continuity (BC)
### Components of a Business Continuity Plan
The term **business** is used often, as this is mostly a business function as opposed to a technical one. <br />
Here are some common components of a comprehensive business continuity plan:
* **List of the BCP team members**, including multiple contact methods and backup members
* **Immediate response procedures and checklists** (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
* **Notification systems and call trees** for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
* **Guidance for management**, including designation of authority for specific managers
* How/when to enact the plan
* **Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain** (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)

#### Terminology
* **Redbook**: Given to the appropriate individual outside the facility. All the procedures are outlined in that document—in case, for example, a hurricane hits, the power is out and all the facilities are compromised and there is 
no access to electronic backups.
* **Business Impact Analysis**: An analysis of an information system's requirement, funuctions and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption.

## Module 3: Understand Disaster Recovery (DR)
### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
* Steps in where BC leaves off (All the tech stuff). 
* Specifically to restoring the **information technology** and **communications services and systems** needed by an organization
* Guides the actions of emergency response personnel until the end goal is reached.(Restore to full last-known reliable operations.)

### Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan
he following list includes various types of documents worth considering:
* **Executive summary** providing a **high-level overview** of the plan
* **Department-specific** plans
* **Technical guides** for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
* **Full copies of the plan** for critical disaster recovery team members
* ** Managers and public relations personnel** will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help them communicate the issue accurately without 
requiring input from team members who are busy working on the recovery.
